### ATP
- The release of the phosphate at the tip of the triphosphate tail makes energy available to cells
- Cells spend ATP continuously.
- Cellular work spends ATP, which is recycled when ADP and phosphate are combined, using
energy released by cellular respiration.
- Up to 10 million ATPs are consumed and recycled each second in a working muscle cell.

### cellular respiration
- Cellular respiration is
- aerobic harvesting of chemical energy from organic fuel molecules,
- the main way that chemical energy is harvested from food and
converted to ATP, and
- an aerobic process—it requires oxygen

### overview : cellular respiration occurs in 3 main stage
- **glucolysis(糖酵解)**: happen in cytoplasm(细胞质)
  - glucose(6C) -> 2 molecules of pyruvate(丙酮酸)(3C)
- **citric acid cycle(柠檬酸循环)+preparation**: happen in mitochondrion(线粒体)
  - preparation: pyruvate bounds with Coenzyme A(辅酶A) and become the acetylCoA(乙酰辅酶A)
  - pyruvate(3C) -> CO2(1C) + electrons
- **oxidative phosphorylation(氧化磷酸化)**: happen in mitochondrion
  - electron transport chain used to phophorylate ADP(potential of H+ ion gradientd)
- 高中生物书上的三个过程：
  -  葡萄糖 -> 丙酮酸 + CO2 + 少量能量
  -  丙酮酸 -> 【H】 + CO2 + 少量能量 
  -  【H】+ CO2 -> NAD+ + H2O
  -  注意和上面的三个过程不太对应qwq

glycogen(糖原) and fat store excess calories

About 20% energy produced by your body each day is used to sustain your brain.

### lactic acid fermentation 乳酸发酵（人类的无氧呼吸）
Human muscle use lactic acid fermentation to **produce ATP without ATP**

### yeast
- yeast is capable of cellular respiration and fermentation(发酵).
- yeast可以有氧呼吸(cellular respiration)产生CO2
- 也可以无氧呼吸产生酒精进行发酵

### The region of an enzyme to which a substrate(底物) binds is called the ___site.
- **active**
- substrate
- enzymatic
- inactive

### What molecules are scientists currently trying to use to power nanotechnology devices, such as microscopic robots?
- **enzymes**

---

### An enzyme's function is most dependent on its ________.
- pH
- temperature
- **shape**
- size

---

### The first electron acceptor of cellular respiration is ________.
- CO2
- O2
- **NAD+**
- H2O

---

### During cellular respiration, electrons move through a series of electron acceptor molecules. Which of the following is a TRUE statement about this process?
- The electrons gain energy as they move from one electron acceptor to another.
- **Oxygen is eventually reduced by the electrons to form water.**
- The electrons release large amounts of energy each time they are transferred from one electron acceptor to another.(但是电子的移动确实会释放一定的能量，可能这里是因为large才错了)
- Glucose is eventually reduced by the electrons to form water.

- **the movement of hydrogen ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane**
- the citric acid cycle
- fermentation
- the electron transport chain

### Enzymes increase the rate of a reaction by **decreasing activation energy**

---

### The sum total of all the chemical reactions that occur in organisms is called **metabolism**

---

### Energy is transferred from ATP to other molecules by transferring a(n) ________.	
- adenosine
- heat unit
- ADP
- **phosphate group**(磷酸基)
