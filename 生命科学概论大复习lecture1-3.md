# Lecture 1
- observation allow us to draw tentative explantions called **hypothesis**
- Hypothesis makes predictions that can be tested by **observation and experiments**
### interconnections within biological systems
(1) molecules and atoms -> (2) organelles（细胞器） -> (3) cells -> (4) tissues -> (5) organ systems and organs -> (6) organisms -> (7) populations(种群) -> (8) communities（群落） -> (9) ecosystems -> (10) biosphere(生物圈)

# Lecture 2
## Elements,Atoms and Molecules
The element composite in human:
O(65%), C(18.5%), H(9.5%), N(3.3%)

The living and non-living worlds share **the same chemical foundation** and obey the same pysical laws!**(the kinds of chemical element in them are same, but not the proportions)**

### Atoms（原子）
- smallest unit of matter taht retains the properties of the element
- split into 3 particles
  - protons(+ charge)
  - neutron(0 charge)
  - electrons(- charge)
- nucleus: protons and neutrons

### radioactive isotopes(放射性同位素)
- isotopes are alternate mass forms of an element.
- a radioactive isotope is one in which the nucleus decays spontaneously.

### strong chemical bond:covalent bonds(共价键) result from two atoms share electrons
- strong chemical bond
- two atoms share one or more pairs of outer shell electrons
- forms molecules(two or more atoms phtsically held together)
- two types:
  - polar(unequal charges)
  - none-polar(equal charges)

### strong chmical bond: ionic bonds(离子键)
- tend to occur between elements with many/few electrons in outer shell

### four categories of large biological molecules found in all living creatures:
- carbohydrates
  - monosaccharides(单糖)(usually some multiple of CH2O)
    - common: glucose(葡萄糖) and fructose(果糖)
  - disacchcaride(二糖)
    - common: lactose(乳糖) and maltose(麦芽糖)
  - polysaccharides（多糖）
    - common: starch（淀粉）、glycogen（糖原） and cellulose（纤维素）
- lipids
  - lipid are amphipathic molecules（双性分子）
    - hydrophilic: water-loving
    - hydrophobic: water-fearing
  - fat
    - store energy
    - hydriphobic molecules（疏水）
    - composed by glycerol(甘油) and fatty acid（脂肪酸）
    - trans fat(反式脂肪酸) is a kind of unsatuated(不饱和的) fat, and is very bad for health.
  - pospholipids（磷脂）
    - major component of cell membranes（细胞膜）
  - steroids（类固醇）
    - cholesterol(胆固醇)：LDL(low-density lipoprotein is bad) HDL(high-density lipoprotein is good)
- proteins
  - of the molecules we discuss, proteins are the most elaborate（复杂精细的） and diverse
  - **20 amino acid in total**
  - the structure of protein
    - (1) primary: unique amino acid sequence
    - (2) secondary: α-helix, β-pleated sheet; maintained by H-bonds
    - (3) tertiary: overall 3-D shape
    - (4) think 3-D, but with neighbors.
  - most proteins are globular in shape
  - specific shape determines specific function:(denature(变性):changing the structure of a protein will change the function)
- nucleic acids

### Water’s Life-Supporting Properties：adhesion and cohsion.

# Lecture 3 Structural Organization of Cells
### discovery of cells
- Robert Hooke: observe the dead plant cells and name them.
- Leeuwenhoek（列文虎克）: first observe the live cells.
- Schleiden（施莱登） and Scwann（施旺）systematically studied tissues of plants and animals under the microscope and showed:
  - cells are the building blocks of all living things
  - All cells have similar structure: nucleus and membrane.
- ...

### Plasma membrane and cell surface
- cell membranes contain hydrophilic outer surfaces and hydrophobic core.

### plasma membrane
plasma membrane has selective permeability: some things get through(**eg.gases; alcohol, acetone(丙酮); lon(离子), sugar, proteins, lipid...**), others don't.
- passive transport
  - No energy required
- active transport
  - energy required
  - molecules moved against gradient
- **exocytosis** is the movement of materials out of the cytoplasm of a cell via membranous vesicles or vacuoles that fuse with the plasma membrane
- **endocytosis**, a cell yakes material in via vesicles that bud inward.

### oranelle
- ribosome 核糖体
- ER 内质网(Rough ER & Smooth ER)
- The Golgi Apparatus 高尔基体
- secretory proteins:
  - (1) a ribosome links amino acids
  - (2) proteins are modified in the ER（ER is the position which synthsis the secretary protein, not te Golgi）
  - (3) Golgi process it.
- mitochondria 线粒体
- chloroplasts 叶绿体
- lysosome 溶酶体
  - found in animal cells
  - digestive exzymes enclosed in a membranous sac（hydrolytic enzymes水解酶）
  - two functions
    - breaking down the molecules of damaged organelles
    - breaking down the foreign matter
- 在光学显微镜下最小能看到线粒体叶绿体等，看不到核糖体和溶酶体什么的.....

### Which of the following statements concerning saturated fats is not true?（fatty acids are the same）
	
- They contain more hydrogen than unsaturated fats having the same number of carbon atoms.
- **They have multiple double bonds in the carbon chains of their fatty acids.**
- They generally solidify at room temperature.
- They are one of several factors that contribute to atherosclerosis.（动脉粥样硬化）
- They are more common in animals than in plants.

### The presence of cholesterol in the plasma membranes of some animals
- **enables the membrane to stay fluid more easily when cell temperature drops.**

---

### Liquid water's high specific heat is mainly a consequence of the
- **absorption and release of heat when hydrogen bonds break and form.**

---

### Which of the following best describes the logic of scientific inquiry?
- **If my hypothesis is correct, I can expect certain test results.**
- If my experiments are set up right, they will lead to a testable hypothesis.

### Why is the theme of evolution considered to be the core theme of biology by biologists?

- Controversy about this theory provides a basis for a great deal of experimental research.
- It is recognized as the core theme of biology by organizations such as the National Science Foundation.
- Since it cannot be proven, biologists will be able to study evolutionary possibilities for many years.
- **It provides a framework within which all biological investigation makes sense.**
- Biologists do not subscribe to alternative models.
