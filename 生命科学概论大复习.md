# Lecture 1
- observation allow us to draw tentative explantions called **hypothesis**
- Hypothesis makes predictions that can be tested by **observation and experiments**
### interconnections within biological systems
(1) molecules and atoms -> (2) organelles（细胞器） -> (3) cells -> (4) tissues -> (5) organ systems and organs -> (6) organisms -> (7) populations(种群) -> (8) communities（群落） -> (9) ecosystems -> (10) biosphere(生物圈)

# Lecture 2
## Elements,Atoms and Molecules
The element composite in human:
O(65%), C(18.5%), H(9.5%), N(3.3%)

The living and non-living worlds share **the same chemical foundation** and obey the same pysical laws!**(the kinds of chemical element in them are same, but not the proportions)**

### Atoms（原子）
- smallest unit of matter taht retains the properties of the element
- split into 3 particles
  - protons(+ charge)
  - neutron(0 charge)
  - electrons(- charge)
- nucleus: protons and neutrons

### radioactive isotopes(放射性同位素)
- isotopes are alternate mass forms of an element.
- a radioactive isotope is one in which the nucleus decays spontaneously.

### strong chemical bond:covalent bonds(共价键) result from two atoms share electrons
- strong chemical bond
- two atoms share one or more pairs of outer shell electrons
- forms molecules(two or more atoms phtsically held together)
- two types:
  - polar(unequal charges)
  - none-polar(equal charges)

### strong chmical bond: ionic bonds(离子键)
- tend to occur between elements with many/few electrons in outer shell

### four categories of large biological molecules found in all living creatures:
- carbohydrates
  - monosaccharides(单糖)(usually some multiple of CH2O)
    - common: glucose(葡萄糖) and fructose(果糖)
  - disacchcaride(二糖)
    - common: lactose(乳糖) and maltose(麦芽糖)
  - polysaccharides（多糖）
    - common: starch（淀粉）、glycogen（糖原） and cellulose（纤维素）
- lipids
  - fat
    - store energy
    - hydriphobic molecules（疏水）
    - composed by glycerol(甘油) and fatty acid（脂肪酸）
    - trans fat(反式脂肪酸) is a kind of unsatuated(不饱和的) fat, and is very bad for health.
  - pospholipids（磷脂）
    - major component of cell membranes（细胞膜）
  - steroids（类固醇）
    - cholesterol(胆固醇)：LDL(low-density lipoprotein is bad) HDL(high-density lipoprotein is good)
- proteins
  - of the molecules we discuss, proteins are the most elaborate（复杂精细的） and diverse
  - **20 amino acid in total**
  - the structure of protein
    - (1) primary: unique amino acid sequence
    - (2) secondary: α-helix, β-pleated sheet; maintained by H-bonds
    - (3) tertiary: overall 3-D shape
- nucleic acids
